# Enhanced Claude Context System

## Project Overview

This project represents a complete reimagining and implementation of an intelligent, context-aware system for AI interactions, combined with a sophisticated media intelligence platform. Built from the ground up during a comprehensive `/init` process, it addresses the fundamental challenges of context drift, behavioral consistency, and intelligent content management across multiple interfaces and platforms.

## Why This System Was Built

### Core Problems Addressed

1. **Context Drift Prevention**: Traditional AI interactions suffer from gradual drift away from user intentions and specified behavioral parameters. This system implements proactive monitoring and automatic context refresh to maintain coherence throughout extended sessions.

2. **Behavioral Consistency**: Different AI personas and contexts required different communication styles and capabilities, but these weren't consistently maintained across sessions or interfaces. The new system ensures uniform behavior regardless of entry point (CLI, VS Code, chat interface).

3. **Content Discovery Challenges**: Finding specific files across large collections of photos, videos, music, and documents was time-consuming and relied on exact filename matching. The system provides natural language search capabilities that understand intent and context.

4. **Manual Media Management**: Organizing and accessing media required manual folder navigation and filename-based searches. The intelligent system automatically extracts metadata, creates contextual tags, and enables intuitive queries.

5. **Interface Fragmentation**: Different tools and interfaces required different approaches to the same tasks, creating inconsistent user experiences. This system provides unified functionality across all interaction methods.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Context Hierarchy System

The system implements a cascading context inheritance model:

```
~/CLAUDE.md (Global Behavioral Rules)
├── Development/repo/CLAUDE.md (General Development Context)
│   ├── Convesio/CLAUDE.md (Full-time Job Context)
│   ├── Cruise-Made-Easy/CLAUDE.md (Travel Agency Business Context)
│   ├── KSStorm/CLAUDE.md (Storm Chasing Website Context)
│   ├── Personal/CLAUDE.md (Personal Projects Context)
│   └── Virtual-News-Center/CLAUDE.md (Client Work Context)
├── Documents/CLAUDE.md (Document Management Context)
└── bin/CLAUDE.md (Scripts and Utilities Context)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Always Inherit**: Child contexts inherit all parent behaviors and rules
- **Context-Specific Enhancement**: Each level adds relevant guidance without overriding core principles
- **Automatic Loading**: System detects appropriate context based on current working directory and task type

### 2. Media Intelligence System

Built entirely in Node.js for universal compatibility and easy deployment, the media intelligence system provides comprehensive metadata extraction and natural language search capabilities.

#### Core Components

**Database Layer (SQLite)**

- **Intelligent Processing**: Debounced updates, duplicate detection, size limits
- **Background Indexing**: Automatic metadata extraction for new files
- **Error Handling**: Robust failure recovery and logging

## Mandatory Behavioral Requirements

The system enforces four non-negotiable behavioral principles embedded at the global level:

### 1. Interview-Style Communication
- **One Question at a Time**: Never ask multiple questions in a single interaction
- **Complete Response Waiting**: Ensure 100% understanding before proceeding
- **Confirmation Before Action**: Verify context and intent before implementation

### 2. Proactive Context Management
- **Automatic Drift Detection**: Monitor for task type changes, milestone moments, focus shifts
- **Context Auto-Refresh**: Don't wait for `/drifting` command - refresh proactively
- **Scope Intelligence**: Refresh at the most appropriate context level

### 3. High Confidence Threshold
- **95% Confidence Requirement**: Never proceed without high confidence in understanding
- **Solution Confidence**: Require 95% confidence in any proposed solution
- **Clarification Over Assumption**: Ask questions rather than guess intent

### 4. Solution Approval Requirement
- **No Premature Implementation**: Never begin coding/writing until user approves the plan
- **Exception Handling**: Only proceed without approval when explicitly instructed
- **Complete Planning**: Always present full implementation plan before starting
